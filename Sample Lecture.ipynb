That is because of the concept of **conjugate priors**: the normal distribution is conjugate to itself with respect to a Gaussian likelihood function. A mathematical proof and more information on this can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxiYXllc2VjdHxneDplNGY0MDljNDA5MGYxYTM).
